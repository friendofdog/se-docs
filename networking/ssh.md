SSH
===

When examining the public key of a remote server, something like the following will be returned:

`[size in bits] [encoding]:[fingerprint] [comment] [something printed by program evoking this info]`

Example:

`2048 SHA256:CxIuAEc3SZThY9XobrjJIHN61OTItAU0Emz0v/+15wY kevinkee@Kevins-MacBook-Pro.local (RSA)`
