Python Classes
==============

> A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state. (From https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-classes-and-objects/)

Although the concepts are distinct, the words "class" and "object" are sometimes used interchangeably in Python.

The upper case namespace is reserved for classes in Python. As a convention, class names are written in `CamelCase` (whereas function names are lower case and `underscore_separated`).
